------
 How?
------

-------
 What?
-------

| **Instahack** is a slick bash script to perform  **brute force** attack against **Instagram** ,

| Instahack is **proved** and can test **over 6M** passwords on a single instagram account with **less resource** as possible
| This script mimics the activities of the official **instagram android app** and sends request over **tor** so you are secure ,
